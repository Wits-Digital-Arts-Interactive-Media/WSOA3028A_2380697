    <h1>Turing - 1950 - Computing Machinery and Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>Why did I choose this reading?</h2>
    <p>
      I have elected to explore the Turing Test due to my profound interest in
      philosophy,<br />
      where I engage in critical thinking within both pragmatic and abstract
      realms. <br />
      In the pragmatic sense, I am intrigued by the practical applications
      within our contemporary society. <br />
      Simultaneously, I find great satisfaction in delving into the unanswerable
      questions and the subjective interpretations of morals and ethics,
      <br />thereby embracing the more abstract facets of philosophical inquiry.
    </p>
    <h3>How have I approached this reading?</h3>
    <p>
      I employed dialectical questioning as a method to gauge my comprehension
      of each segment within the reading,<br />
      thereby eliciting my school of thought and shaping a nuanced perspective
      on the subject matterpertaining to machine-based thinking.
      <br />
      The goal was to express my understanding using empirical evidence,
      historical context and further research <br />
      for the formulation of a discerning and well-informed opinion on the
      matter at hand.
    </p>
    <h3>Let us now explore!</h3>
    <h4>
      What are your thoughts on Turing's "imitation game" as a method for
      determining whether a machine can think?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I appreciate the fact that, instead of turning, focusing on perceivable
      consciousness within machines,<br />
      he chooses to experiment with a more observable and practical approach of
      machines to mimic patterns of human behaviour.
      <br />
      I feel that this approach creates a sense of structure, and organization
      within a heavily debated discussion;<br />
      it leaves less room for ambiguity and centralizes qualitative human
      thinking/processing.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Do you believe successfully imitating human behaviour in a conversation is
      a valid criterion for considering a machine as capable of thinking?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I feel that successful machine programming, in the form of information
      retrieval to respond in accordance with external observation,<br />
      serves as the 'artificial brain' for machines; this allows them to mimic
      basic human responses for limited forms of human-to-robot interaction.<br />
      It is limited because may not fully grasp the nature of visceral human
      responses (due to its vast unpredictability). <br />However I do not think
      that this serves as much of a hindrance, especially in the context of this
      discussion,<br />
      as machines will have a general framework enough to exhibit observable
      human qualities.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Are there specific aspects or qualities essential for defining
      intelligence in machines beyond the ability to imitate human responses?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I feel that archetypal machine intelligence would be its ability to
      generate a relevant set of ideas/concepts based on external inquiry<br />
      - is the machine response pertinent to what is being asked/explored?<br />
      It should be able to utilize some forms of inductive and deductive
      reasoning from its current/pre-existing cumulative knowledge;
      <br />
      Can it form a set of conclusions from a set of rules/conventions?
      <br />Can it recognize patterns and formulate probable conclusions?
      <br />It should have the faculty to accommodate diverse approaches/schools
      of thought. <br />It should understand the diverse range of basic human
      emotion, enough to understand tone, body language and choice of words to
      interpret humans' behaviour.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How do you see the role of consciousness in the context of machines
      imitating human-like behaviour? Can a machine be considered intelligent
      without possessing consciousness?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I do not see it as an important factor because the reality is that
      machines are artificial creations from humankind.<br />
      Hence, they do not need to possess consciousness to perform human-like
      functions.<br />
      If we isolate the idea of 'thinking' and generally define what it is and
      how it typically functions,
      <br />
      we can translate said concept into tangible functioning to suit the
      capabilities of machinery.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What are your thoughts on the idea that machines could potentially imitate
      human behaviour to the extent that an interrogator<br />
      cannot distinguish between them and a human, as proposed by Turing's
      imitation game?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The ability of machines to successfully imitate human behaviour in the
      form of generating 'natural' responses to a series of questions<br />
      illustrates how powerful programming is as a tool to facilitate fruitful
      learning to assess the extent of our own knowledge <br />
      and understanding of a concept through Socratic questioning.
      <br />It serves a more interesting form of learning new concepts and can
      assist in expanding/diversifying our current schools of thought in the
      form of conversation, <br />instead of solely relying on our
      interpretation - making learning more accessible to people with
      disabilities as well.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How do you see the distinction between the physical and intellectual
      capacities of humans, as discussed in the critique of the new problem?<br />
      Do you think it's a valid and practical way to explore machine
      intelligence?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I think that it's a brilliant way of isolating the concept of thinking
      within a conversation,<br />
      without the 'blur' of preconceived notions based on physical
      appearance.<br />
      Humans are prone to social profiling based on physical observation, which
      can heavily influence how they respond to varying social situations.
      <br />
      It creates a more objective outlook on the explored concept and therefore
      does not have to emphasize or even account <br />
      for physical observable attributes in producing human-like thinking.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The critique mentions the advantage of the question-and-answer method in
      the imitation game.
      <br />
      What do you think about this method to determine whether a machine can
      think? Are there limitations you see in this approach?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I feel that it creates a metric for testing a machine's ability to
      acknowledge varying forms of human response and thus respond accordingly,
      <br />
      using pertinent knowledge to satisfy a social interaction.
      <br />The limitations would be its ability to mimic human error in the
      form of delayed thinking, <br />flawed/limited understanding of concepts,
      and personal bias that results in unique outlooks on particular
      situations.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Turing suggests that even if a machine could mimic human behaviour
      perfectly, it might not make sense to make the machine more human-like
      physically.
      <br />What is your take on this perspective? Do you agree or disagree, and
      why?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I fully agree that we do not need to personify the machine to appear more
      human-like because it creates a distorted reality of what they truly
      are.<br />
      I think that we should embrace its artificial nature enough to distinguish
      them from an actual human; <br />
      there is value in what it can perform more efficiently as a machine but
      does not need to undervalue humans or compete with them.
      <br />Humans actively discuss and experience a subset of moral/ethical
      dilemmas that form part of the spectrum of open-ended concepts; <br />the
      algorithmic nature of robots thus forms an irreconcilable nature with this
      and therefore serves as a true limitation to its existence. <br />Its
      existence is unique in itself, and though it exhibits human qualities, it
      will never be a human, as a matter of objective truth.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What are your thoughts on Turing's decision to exclude machines that are
      essentially humans born in the usual manner from participating in the
      imitation game?
      <br />
      Do you find this exclusion justified?
    </h4>
    <p>
      It makes sense within the context of this experiment to isolate the test
      to assess a machine's ability to imitate human-like responses<br />
      by not involving the complexity of genuine human experiences.
      <br />
      While I believe that experience plays an important role in the knowledge,
      ideas, and general thought patterns possessed by humans,<br />
      the focus should be on the ability of machines to demonstrate intelligent
      behaviour, irrespective of their origin.
      <br />It creates a separation between the subjective
      outlooks/interpretations woven within human experience <br />
      and the pure ability to think, process, and have a mere logical
      conversation.
      <br />Hence, I believe that this exclusion is justified to suit the
      intended purpose of this experiment.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Turing suggests restricting the definition of machines in the imitation
      game to digital computers. <br />What do you think about this limitation?
      <br />Do you see it as a reasonable choice, or would you prefer a broader
      definition?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I feel that his limitation was appropriate, given the era (1950s) that
      this thought experiment was conducted;<br />
      digital computers were progressively becoming more powerful and flexible
      tools for computational and informational processing.
      <br />This restriction is what promoted a more practical approach to
      examining machine thinking,<br />
      as opposed to an unprecedented form of technological advancement.
      <br />However, I think it would be too restrictive in a contemporary sense
      where advancements in AI have expanded into various forms of neural
      networks, <br />machine learning, and other computational paradigms.
      <br />
      The term 'machine' has also evolved to encompass an extensive range of
      systems that do not represent an archetypal digital computer.<br />
      These diverse forms of AI allow us to experiment even further, and perhaps
      reach a unique set of conclusions for each of them;
      <br />
      it highlights individual benefits/disadvantages depending on the system
      that is being utilized.
    </p>
    <h4>
      How do you interpret Turing's statement that the identification of
      machines with digital computers<br />
      will only be unsatisfactory if digital computers are unable to give a good
      showing in the game?
      <br />
      Do you agree with this perspective?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I feel that this identification reaffirms his belief in the potential of
      digital computers to demonstrate human-like intelligence. <br />It further
      suggests that if they can indeed mimic human behaviour in the form of
      intelligible, and indistinguishable responses,<br />
      then regarding them as machines is justified.
      <br />This stance is what aligns with the ultimate criterion of his work,
      <br />
      that being the pragmatic and observable approach where the definition of
      intelligence <br />
      is directly tied to the capacity to produce intelligent behaviour in a
      specific context, such as the imitation game.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Turing mentions the possibility of constructing machines using
      experimental methods that might be hard to describe.
      <br />What are your thoughts on allowing such experimental machines to
      participate in the imitation game? <br />Do you see any challenges or
      advantages in doing so?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I firmly believe that learning is dynamic, as we are continually
      discovering and forming new ideas,
      <br />and while we are more likely to research faster based on what
      already know, I think that fundamentally, <br />
      it is equally important to adopt experimental methods/techniques (creative
      and out-of-box thinking) as it promotes innovation,
      <br />
      in the form of novel algorithms that exist outside of traditional
      programming. <br />
    </p>
      <p>
      Resultantly, this may give rise to a new set of machine capabilities that
      further advance our understanding of AI and how it can be better utilized
      <br />
      to suit a wider variety or more nuanced goals.
    </p>
      <br />However, I also believe that innovation can sometimes pose a set of
      challenges,<br />
      namely the difficulty of forming an accurate and reliable understanding of
      new concepts, since they are not as researched/documented.
      <br />
      Hence, it may require additional time and resources to truly define this
      set of new parameters<br />
      that make innovative concepts generally sound so that it can serve as a
      reliable basis for more practical implementation in the future. <br />
      An inherent issue may also be personal bias in carrying out certain
      thought experiments,<br />
      which goes into a deeper philosophical argument of 'is there true
      objectivity?
      <br />
      Albeit I understand that the Turing test promotes a pragmatic approach
      foremost.
      <br />How may this lead to unintended consequences? <br />Additionally, I
      think that it would be difficult to perform a fair risk-benefit and
      <br />
      qualitative analysis on the effectiveness of varying approaches and
      techniques;
      <br />
      How do we define a metric of intelligence to accommodate the diversity and
      nuances of programming?
