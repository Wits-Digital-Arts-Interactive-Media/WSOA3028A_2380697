        specializing <br />in Information Engineering for an addiitonal 2
        years.<br />I would like to utilize my Game Design experience in the
        form of creative and out-of-box thinking to enhance to enhance software
        designing capabilites.
        <br />
        I would to bridge the gap between the more rigid and technical approach
        of software programming<br />
