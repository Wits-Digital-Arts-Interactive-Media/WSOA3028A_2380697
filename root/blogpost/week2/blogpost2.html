    <h1>Exploring The Strucuture Of HTML</h1>
    <h2>
      Discussing My Folder Structure, URL scheme and general decision-making
    </h2>
    <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
    <p>
      I believe that this is essential for organizing and maintaining my project
      throughout its initial development stages and its active refinement
    </p>
    <h4>How have I decided to approach this?</h4>
    <p>
      I create 'root' folders that contain the main index.html <br />
      Thereafter, an additional folders are created to store the images, css and
      javascript files respectively.<br />
      These folders are easily accessible when referencing them as images or
      hyperlinks in the index.html
      <br />
      Additional folders are also created to store blogpost specific content,
      which will follow the same pattern of hierachial folder creation<br />
      I felt that this system allowed to keep track of information more
      efficiently, <br />
      and to distinguish between varying html links and their respective set of
      files
    </p>

    <h3>URL Scheme</h3>
    <p>
      I understand to a a way to navigate and locate resources on the web.<br />
      It provides a hierarchical and organized way to access different pages and
      assets within a website.
    </p>
    <h4>How am I approaching this?</h4>
    <p>
      I am utilzing my folder strucutre, that being a hierarchical file system
      for my website, <br />where the main page acts as the 'root' or 'trunk' of
      a tree. <br />
      This main page is then divided into different topics, each functioning as
      a 'branch' that further extends into more detailed content.<br />
      These individual topics serve as references or links to additional
      pages,<br />
      symbolizing the growth and expansion of the tree-like structure as users
      navigate through the various branches to access specific content on your
      website. <br />This approach provides a clear and organized way to present
      information, <br />allowing users to follow a logical path and explore
      different aspects of your site based on their interests or needs.
    </p>
    <h3>General Design Paramaters</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >This serves as my general thought-process and decision-making
        techniques whilst I am designing the website.</em
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Consistency</strong>: I am sticking to the naming convention,
          and my aforementioned folder structure for ease of navigation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Scalability</strong>: I am considering how user-friendly and
          practical my general design approach is so as my project grows, it is
          sustainable to maintain.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>User-friendly URLs:</strong> I would like to create a website
          that is generally discernible, serving a functional purpose in an
          elegant format.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Research-based Development:</strong> I would like to refine my
          website based on continual learning,<br />through research which
          reveals new knowledge, concept modules and varying techniques.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Current Wireframe</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to map out a primitive wireframe to illustrate my current url
      strucutre; <br />
      this utilizes my html knowledge alone, without any aesthetic
      reference/theme. <br />
      I will actively refine my wireframe as well, as my website is very much
      subject to change.
    </p>

      alt="Wireframe"
      width="500"
      height="400"
    />
    <h3>Website Layout Intention</h3>
    <p>
      I have a genuine appreciation for modern, minimalist design, <br />
      and I aspire to create a website that embodies clarity and
      user-friendliness through its discernible formatting. <br />I am
      particularly drawn to the sophisticated transitions associated with a
      modern yet classic user experience (UX) design. <br />My vision is to
      craft a digital space that not only embraces the elegance of contemporary
      aesthetics <br />
      but also seamlessly integrates intuitive elements to enhance user
      interaction.

    <h3>Inspiration Website Layouts/Designs</h3>
    <p><em>Bruno Simon's 'Game-like' website</em></p>
    <img src="images/WebsiteInspiration/Ref1.png" width="500" height="300" />
    <p>
      <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/" target="_blank"
        >https://bruno-simon.com/</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I find immense enjoyment in the interactive design of Bruno Simon's
      website,<br />
      which fosters a sense of engagement and enhances the learning experience
      about him as a web developer.<br />
      This distinctive approach not only showcases the formidable capabilities
      of web development<br />
      but also underscores the pivotal role of design in captivating an
      audience. <br />As an aspiring game designer,<br />
      I deeply value the artistry infused into the mechanics and transitions,<br />
      making specific pieces of information more discernible. <br />The
      thoughtful integration of user-friendly features, such as the traditional
      cursor mechanic for navigation, <br />adds to the overall accessibility of
      the webpage.<br />
      This consideration for ease of use further underscores the importance of a
      seamless user experience in web development and design.
