    <h1>Exploring The Strucuture Of HTML</h1>
    <h2>
      Discussing My Folder Structure, URL scheme and general decision-making
    </h2>
    <h3>Folder Structure</h3>
    <p>
      I believe that this is essential for organizing and maintaining my project
      throughout its initial development stages and its active refinement
    </p>
    <h4>How have I decided to approach this?</h4>
    <p>
      I create 'root' folders that contain the main index.html <br />
      Thereafter, an additional folders are created to store the images, css and
      javascript files respectively.<br />
      These folders are easily accessible when referencing them as images or
      hyperlinks in the index.html
      <br />
      Additional folders are also created to store blogpost specific content,
      which will follow the same pattern of hierachial folder creation<br />
      I felt that this system allowed to keep track of information more
      efficiently, <br />
      and to distinguish between varying html links and their respective set of
      files
    </p>

    <h3>URL Scheme</h3>
    <p>
      I understand to a a way to navigate and locate resources on the web.<br />
      It provides a hierarchical and organized way to access different pages and
      assets within a website.
    </p>
    <h4>How am I approaching this?</h4>
    <p>
      I am utilzing my folder strucutre, that being a hierarchical file system
      for my website, <br />where the main page acts as the 'root' or 'trunk' of
      a tree. <br />
      This main page is then divided into different topics, each functioning as
      a 'branch' that further extends into more detailed content.<br />
      These individual topics serve as references or links to additional
      pages,<br />
      symbolizing the growth and expansion of the tree-like structure as users
      navigate through the various branches to access specific content on your
      website. <br />This approach provides a clear and organized way to present
      information, <br />allowing users to follow a logical path and explore
      different aspects of your site based on their interests or needs.
    </p>
    <h3>General Design Paramaters</h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >This serves as my general thought-process and decision-making
        techniques whilst I am designing the website.</em
      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Consistency</strong>: I am sticking to the naming convention,
          and my aforementioned folder structure for ease of navigation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Scalability</strong>: I am considering how user-friendly and
          practical my general design approach is so as my project grows, it is
          sustainable to maintain.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>User-friendly URLs:</strong> I would like to create a website
          that is generally discernible, serving a functional purpose in an
          elegant format.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Research-based Development:</strong> I would like to refine my
          website based on continual learning,<br />through research which
          reveals new knowledge, concept modules and varying techniques.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>My Current Wireframe</h3>
    <p>
      I decided to map out a primitive wireframe to illustrate my current url
      strucutre; <br />
      this utilizes my html knowledge alone, without any aesthetic
      reference/theme. <br />
      I will actively refine my wireframe as well, as my website is very much
      subject to change.
    </p>

      width="500"
      height="400"
    />
    <h3>Website Layout Intention</h3>
    <p>
      I have a genuine appreciation for modern, minimalist design, <br />
      and I aspire to create a website that embodies clarity and
      user-friendliness through its discernible formatting. <br />I am
      particularly drawn to the sophisticated transitions associated with a
      modern yet classic user experience (UX) design. <br />My vision is to
      craft a digital space that not only embraces the elegance of contemporary
      aesthetics <br />
      but also seamlessly integrates intuitive elements to enhance user
      interaction.

    </p>
    <p>
      I find immense enjoyment in the interactive design of Bruno Simon's
      website,<br />
      which fosters a sense of engagement and enhances the learning experience
      about him as a web developer.<br />
      I really enjoyed being able to play around with the car on the webpage, as
      there are many ramps, and funny little obstacles.<br />
      This distinctive approach not only showcases the formidable capabilities
      of web development<br />
      but also underscores the pivotal role of design in captivating an
      audience. <br />As an aspiring game designer,<br />
      I deeply value the artistry infused into the mechanics and transitions,<br />
      making specific pieces of information more discernible. <br />The
      thoughtful integration of user-friendly features, such as the traditional
      cursor mechanic for navigation, <br />adds to the overall accessibility of
      the webpage.<br />
      This consideration for ease of use further underscores the importance of a
      seamless user experience in web development and design.

      This website exudes tranquility through an elegant design.<br />
      The use of simple, less saturated colors, coupled with smooth
      transitions,<br />
      establishes a calm and relaxing atmosphere, enhancing the overall
      engagement.<br />
      The addition of subtle music further contributes to a peaceful aura as you
      navigate through each segment of the website. <br />The meticulous
      attention to replicating a serene experience<br />
      reflects a commendable dedication to shaping the desired emotional
      response both for the company and its website visitors. <br />Notably,
      there's a strategic reference to the official website, which serves a more
      informative purpose.<br />
      This suggests that the primary goal of this captivating site is to first
      engage the audience,<br />
      allowing them to appreciate the offerings of the company. The quality of
      the website design plays a pivotal role in achieving this,<br />
      creating a visually pleasing and immersive experience for visitors.

    <p>
      <strong
        >"The website is clean and minimal, but minimal does not mean
        unimaginative"</strong
      >.<br />
      I greatly appreciate the description of the website, as it champions the
      notion that simplicity<br />
      can be just as refined as a more elaborate and complex representation.
      <br />The interactive feature of hovering over words adds a dynamic
      element, <br />revealing new and varied portions of the website in a way
      that is easily discernible to the viewer.<br />
      The transitions are skillfully executed, <br />maintaining the clean and
      solid aesthetic of the webpage. <br />The modest animations and
      interactive elements seamlessly align with the architectural style,
      <br />underscoring a thoughtful coherence in design. <br />It's evident
      that the website has been crafted to mirror the experience the creators
      aim to provide their audience, <br />further emphasizing the harmony
      between design and user engagement. I also appreicate how the scrolling
      functionality is implemented, <br />as it gives rise to seemless
      transitions in both a functional (to relay more information)<br />
      and elegant (to maintain the simplistic aesthetic) manner.

    <h3>Readings For Insight</h3>

    <h4>You Say You Want a Revolution?</h4>
    <h5>What do I think the prime focus of this text is?</h5>
    <p>
      I think that this text primarily focuses on the web,<br />
      exploring the evolution and general impact of hypertext and media
    </p>
    <h5>
      What is the impact of hypertext and the web on our daily lives and
      society?
    </h5>
    <p>
      I belive that within the past 10 years especially,<br />
      in growing up and actively observing changes across the web,<br />
      it has had a profound and transformative impact in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Information Accessibility:</strong><br />
        I feel that the web has significantly increased our ability <br />to
        both retrieve and share vast amounts of information on a diverse range
        of topics.<br />
        This has expanded our resources within education, research and general
        insight on contemporary news.<br />
        This ranges from more scientifically accurate and researched medical
        journals, <br />
        to casual blogposts and recipe websites.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communication and Connectivity:</strong><br />
        I appreciate how much our virtual communication has evolved from
        emails,<br />
        to social media platforms that are able to facilitate communication
        real-time interactions. <br />Resultantly, this has not only eased our
        ability to readily/conveniently communicate with friends and family,<br />
        but fosters a sense of global interconnectedness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Democratization:</strong><br />
        Platforms like reddit allow individuals with an interest to partipicate
        in various discussions,<br />
        for which they can freely share ideas and even publish content for
        public/private acknowledgement.<br />
        This has created an immersive forum for people to learn more information
        and express themselves in an easily accessible way. <br />
        Additionally, empowering individuals and marginalized voices that may
        not have had a platform in traditional media.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cultural and Social Changes:</strong><br />
        I feel social media platforms have become so prevelant within my
        generation.<br />
        and hence plays a significant role in shaping cultural trends and
        societal norms.<br />
        They provide a platform for various kinds of self-expression, activism
        and cultrural exchange<br />
        - which I feel has promoted diversity and inclusion within society.<br />
        However, there has been many concerns associated with mental health,
        privacy and widespread of misinformation.<br />
        I have been cyberbullied in the past about my weight/appearance,<br />
        which was worsened by idealistic views of 'body image'<br />
        and 'diet culture' by social media influencers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Education and Learning:</strong><br />
        I can personally attest to how the web has transformed by educational
        experience. <br />I now have access to a stupendous number of resources
        in the form of educational websites (Chegg, Homeworkify),<br />
        alongside online courses (Udemy) which have supplemented by university
        lecturers. <br />I am able to learn and advance my understanding of
        concepts at my own pace to avoid feeling overwhelmed during in-person
        lecturers.
        <br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>
      What is my take on the influence of large corprate websites versus<br />
      individual contributions in shaping the online experience?
    </h5>
    <p>
      I feel like there is a dynamic relationship with the two,<br />
      as corporations adopt successful ideas from individual contributors
      (mostly social media influencers)<br />
      to innovate and market products that will appeal to the mass populas of
      viewers<br />
      - feeding into internet culture trends. <br />Albeit, individual
      contributors also gain exposure through partnerships (often sponsorships)
      or collaborations with larger entities.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Their distinctive roles/influence</strong></p>
    <p><em>Large Corporate Websites</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>User Experience:</strong><br />
        They are able to subsidize more time and resources into designing
        polished, and user-friendly interfaces.<br />
        This plays a huge role in creating a visually appealing experience to
        captivate and target a particular demographic. <br />
        It seems that despite the freelancer's capability to craft a refined
        online experience,<br />
        their efforts may inevitably be hindered by the larger corporations'
        tendency to prioritize speed over meticulousness,<br />
        often reaching the average consumer much quicker.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business Models</strong>:<br />
        These larger entities have created online job opportunities to diverse
        revenue generating opportunities. <br />This has not only given rise to
        e-commerce marketplaces,<br />
        but improves the exposure of 'brick-and-motar' establishments - simply
        through advertisement of services.<br />
        Furthermore, they also have access to monetization strategies<br />
        and can actively consult with their marketing team to improve
        user-engagement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Distribution Of Content:<br /></strong>
        They have access to a vast amount of of resources, and intercompany
        connections<br />
        which allow them to fashion, curate and disseminate information to a
        global audience. <br />I feel that this plays a huge role in what is
        readily accessible to us as the average consumer,<br />
        and often shapes other small companies to follow suit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Individual Contributors</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Perspective Diversity:</strong><br />
        I feel that social media influencers are able to share unique
        perspectives based on anecdotal experiences,<br />
        using blogs, personal websites and more simply social media platforms.
        <br />The fact that this occurs on a global scale means that we can
        become cognizant and <br />
        learn from a diverse range of opinions. <br />I truly believe that this
        has helped destigmatize talking about more sensitive topics<br />
        (such as sexuality and addiction) in the most logical, yet emotionally
        attuned way possible - we are all people after all!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open-source Content: </strong><br />Wikipedia, OER Commons are
        prime examples of user-generated content<br />
        that harness the collective knowledge and creativity of inidividuals.<br />
        Additionally, there is many open-source software on GitHub for which<br />
        there is constant code refine through community-driven
        collaborations.<br />
        I feel as though this had led to the creation of valuable resources
        <br />and fosters unique online learning experiences through global
        forums.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adaptability:</strong>
        I feel as though social media influencers have been adaptable to
        emerging trends or niche interests <br />which generally promotes a more
        open-minded perspective on the internet. <br />They have been quick to
        experiment with<br />
        new formats, ideas and technologies without tedious bureacratic
        processes that larger entities face. <br />I appreciate the creative
        liberty of some influencers as their content appears less 'generic'.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Considering McLuhan's idea of a medium reversing when taken to its
      limit<br />, what do I believe the Web becomes at its extreme?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I believe this idea suggests that when a medium is taken to its 'extreme'
      or reaches its perceived limit,<br />
      it can have adverse effects that stray from its intention.
    </p>
    <p>How does this manifest?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Information Overload:<br /></strong>
        I feel like the sheer volume of data and content across the web can
        be<br />
        quite overwhelming or challenging for users to ascertain the
        information<br />
        that is most relevant, accurate and meaningful to them.<br />
        <em>There is simply too much to navigate through!</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loss Of Depth & Context:<br /></strong>
        I feel as though short-form content, rapid scolling and quick
        consumption patterns through algorithms<br />
        (such as YouTube shorts, tiktoks and instagram reels) could lead to an
        oversimplication of complex subjects. <br />It sort of creates the
        'broken telephone' problem, <br />where nuances derived from its
        historical context is overlooked.<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Erosion Of Privacy:<br /></strong>
        I feel as though my privacy is labelled as a 'priority' when in
        actuality there is <br />constant surveillance, data collection and the
        commodification of my personal information<br />
        across social media platforms (such as Facebook).<br />
        The mere fact that there are court-cases filed, <br />such as the 2018
        Facebook debacle is very telling of the societal concerns and ethical
        issues that we are currently facing.<br />
        <em>Are we desensitized to our basic right to privacy?</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Echo Chambers:<br /></strong>
        I feel like because of existing algorithms that curate content based on
        our preferences, <br />it often reinforces echo chambers and
        polarization.<br />
        Hence, we have limited exposure to varying perspectives,<br />
        which I think intrinsically promotes entrenched beliefs and
        instrumentally creates greater divides within society.<br />
      </li>
